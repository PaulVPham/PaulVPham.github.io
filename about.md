<p>Hi, most people call me Paul. My family calls me Huy. I like both. I have always been curious and creative from building Legos, studying history, cooking non-stop, traveling, becoming fluent in Vietnamese, and now learning product development to foster a user-focused and technical mindset. Curiosity drives my passion to learn and challenge myself and grow with the people around me. I have found technology and product management to be a great partner in that regard.</p>

<p>I currently work at a software company in a technical support role. Ask me about Quickbooks and Outlook integrations. I investigate complex technical issues, maintain and prioritize bugs in a backlog, and work towards providing the best customer experience possible. Through these responsibilities, I have discovered an interest in building software that provides users value. Interacting with product, engineering, and UX teams daily has given me exposure to the depth and effort required to develop products that can change people's lives.</p>

<p>In my free time, this is what I do. I study different technologies, build programs, and talk to engineers, designers, and PMs. I push myself to solve problems, create apps, wireframes, and products I think others would love. Or I will be cooking some recipe I found on Reddit.</p>
