Hi, most people call me Paul. My family calls me Huy. I have always had my curiosity with me from building Legos, studying history, cooking non-stop, traveling, becoming fluent in Vietnamese, and now learning web development to foster a product-driven and technical mindset. The bigger picture is that curiosity drives my passion to learn and create from within myself and with the people around me. I have found that technology is guiding me in that direction.

I currently work at a software company in a technical support role. I investigate complex tier two support issues, maintain and prioritize a bug backlog, and work towards providing the best customer experience possible. Through these responsibilities, I have discovered an interest in building great software that provides users values and all the moving parts. Interacting with product, engineering, and UX teams daily has given me exposure to the depth and effort required to create intuitive and products that can change people's lives.

In my free time, this is what I do. I study different technologies, build programs here and there, delve into product management, and challenge myself to solve problems and create apps, wireframes, and products I think others would love.
