<strong>Project: </strong><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/AW3611OB93GFR/">View</a> |


In this project, I looked over the ABC News mobile app designed by TribalScale to learn more about the company's product mindset and user experience.

It is a combination of product and end user considerations based on three features: <br />
    1. First Touch, Onboarding <br />
    2. Alerts <br />
    3. Settings <br />
    <br />
I aimed to demonstrate proficiency in understanding the product's value to the user in different roles.
