Ideally as a user, I should be able to log into my app to upload recipes with a picture, description, ingredients, and directions. A combination of my love for cooking and technology making it easy to find everything in one place. It is possible to use HAML for the views files. My choice however is still ERB for it. This project is still a work in progress.
