This is the first Rails App I created. It initially provided with an overview of programming and web development. The app is a newsletter that stores email addresses and send newsletters through MailChimp while tracking email activity through SendGrid. Notifications are sent to my Gmail account regarding any messages or signups.

Through the process I learned about:
<ul>
  <li>Ruby, Ruby Gems, and RVM</li>
  <li>UNIX command line/terminal basics</li>
  <li>Git Version Control</li>
  <li>Product - User Stories</li>
  <li>APIs and Environment Variables - SendGrid & MailChimp</li>
  <li>Local, Staging, and Deploying to Production (Heroku)</li>
  <li>Google Analytics Integration</li>
  <li>Design with Zurb Foundation</li>
</ul>
