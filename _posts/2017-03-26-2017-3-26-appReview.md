In this project, I looked over the ABC News mobile app designed by TribalScale to learn more about the company's product mindset and user experience.

It is a combination of product and end user considerations based on three features:
1. First Touch/Onboarding
2. Alerts
3. Settings

I aimed to demonstrate proficiency in understanding the product's value to the user in different roles.
