<strong>Background:</strong>
<br />
I use a Google Calendar to log my productive activity daily. My Google Calendar is covered in calendar events that aren't actually calendar events. At the end of 2016, I added up each event manually. I scrolled through each month counting, writing it in a spreadsheet, and then totaling them. I know I can create a more efficient and user-friendly way.

<strong>Inspiration:</strong>
<br />
I want to go to sleep knowing I did more than the day before. I also want to know that I did more than I did by the end of the week, month, and even year. How many times did I go to the gym, cook a new recipe, learn a new skill, or study a language? It should show a broad overview and the most granular detail. You may have FitBit to track your walking, but what about your growth and productivity everyday?

Over time, you log more activities and you find out that you are doing a lot, much more than you think. I want to share this excitement with everyone else around me. It requires no more than 1-3 minutes to recount what you considered productive in that day. This is where No Zeros come in - you are doing something to better yourself all the time.
