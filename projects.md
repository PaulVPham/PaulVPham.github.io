				<td><em>Assured Commitment: May 1957, Vietnam-U.S. Diplomacy </em></td>
				<td>In this one year project, I started with the concept that in May 1957, Ngo Dinh Diem's grand visit to the U.S. preemptively signaled American commitment to Vietnam. I worked with Laura Kalman, a fantastic professor who always challenged me when it came to better research, writing, and quality. I researched archives, newspapers, books, and other resources including interviewing Vietnam War researchers and scholars. It was a powerful lesson in synthesizing an incredible amount of information to craft a cohesive narrative and demonstrate value in all of it.</td>
