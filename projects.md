				<td>This Website!</td>
				<td>I wanted to put my web dev knowledge to work. Building this site mostly from scratch with my editor and command line was quite the challenge. I am quite proud of how it turned out.</td>

				<td><em>Assured Commitment: May 1957, Vietnam-U.S. Diplomacy </em></td>
				<td>In this project, I assert that Ngo Dinh Diem's visit to the U.S. in May 1957 preemptively signaled the U.S. commitment to Vietnam years before combat troops landed in 1965. I worked with Laura Kalman, a fantastic professor that challenged me every step of the way, always asking me for more when it came to writing, editing, researching, and quality. It was a great lesson in synthesizing an incredible amount of information and discovering the 'so what' factor.</td>
