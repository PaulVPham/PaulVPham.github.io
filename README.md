# Paul's Project Website
This repo's has all the code for my personal website. It has info about me, my projects, resume, and anything else I plan on adding in the future. I didn't do the original design, but I had fun putting all the pieces together and adding a bit of my own style to it. I equally enjoyed learning about Jekyll along the way, purchasing my own domain, and launching a website quickly. This took no longer than a week as I worked on it after work. I started with a CMS the first day, but found out I preferred a text editor, Git, and command line instead.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS & SCSS, JavaScript, Ruby & Jekyll, Atom, Github

Credit for website template design goes to HTML5 UP and Andrew Banchich. Please reference the sections below for more info to see how you can create something awesome yourself.

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
